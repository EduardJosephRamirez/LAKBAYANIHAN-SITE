                    <h3> What is the best time to visit the Philippines?</h3> <br>
                    <p>The best time to visit the Philippines is during the dry season, which runs from December to May. However,
                       you can visit year-round, as the weather varies by region, and some places, like Bohol or Davao, are great
                       to visit even in the rainy season.

                    <h3> Do I need a visa to visit the Philippines?</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        Citizens from many countries, including the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, and most of Southeast Asia,
                        can enter the Philippines without a visa for stays of up to 30 days. For longer stays or other nationalities,
                        please check the official Philippine government website or consult with your local embassy.
