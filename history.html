            <h2>Pre-Colonial Period</h2>
            <p>Before the arrival of foreign powers, the Philippines was inhabited by various indigenous groups. These communities developed rich and diverse cultures, languages, and systems of governance. Early Filipinos engaged in trade with neighboring civilizations, including China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Filipino way of life was characterized by barangays, small independent communities led by chiefs or "datus." These early societies were already established long before the arrival of foreign explorers.</p>

             <h2>Spanish Colonial Period (1521–1898)</h2>
             <p>The Philippines’ colonial history began in 1521 when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer sailing for Spain, arrived in the archipelago. He claimed the islands for Spain but was killed in the Battle of Mactan by the local chieftain Lapu-Lapu. Despite Magellan's death, Spanish interest in the Philippines persisted, and in 1565, Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu. Over the next three centuries, the Spanish imposed their rule, converting the local population to Christianity and introducing European institutions and culture.</p>

             <h2>American Colonial Period (1898–1946)</h2>
             <p>Under U.S. rule, the Philippines underwent significant changes. After the Philippine-American War, which began in 1899 and lasted until 1902, the U.S. established a colonial government. While the Americans introduced modern infrastructure, education, and a new legal system, their rule was also marked by challenges. The Philippines saw the rise of a nationalist movement, and many Filipinos demanded greater autonomy. In 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established, marking the beginning of preparations for full independence. Manuel L. Quezon became the first president of the Commonwealth, promoting Filipino culture and self-governance.</p>

             <h2>Post-Independence and Early Republic (1946–1972)</h2>
             <p>The immediate years following independence were marked by efforts to rebuild the country. The Philippines faced economic challenges, social inequality, and political instability. Several presidents led the country during this period, including Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, and Ramon Magsaysay, each addressing different issues facing the nation. However, political tensions grew, and in 1965, Ferdinand Marcos became president, ushering in an era of both development and controversy.</p>

             <h2>Martial Law and Dictatorship (1972–1986)</h2>
             <p>In 1972, Marcos declared Martial Law, citing threats from communist insurgents and separatist movements. Martial Law allowed Marcos to rule by decree, curtailing civil liberties and silencing political opposition. His administration was marked by corruption, human rights abuses, and the accumulation of wealth by the Marcos family. In 1983, the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. sparked widespread protests and calls for change.

                In 1986, the People Power Revolution, a peaceful uprising led by Corazon Aquino (the widow of Benigno Aquino), ousted Marcos from power and restored democracy in the Philippines. This event marked a significant moment in Philippine history, showing the power of non-violent resistance in the fight for democracy.</p>

             <h2>Modern Philippines (1986–Present)</h2>
             <p>Following the fall of Marcos, Corazon Aquino became the first female president of the Philippines. Under her leadership, the country moved towards democratic reforms. However, the Philippines continued to face political instability, including the impeachment and eventual ousting of President Joseph Estrada in 2001, following a second People Power Revolution. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Estrada's vice president, assumed the presidency.</p>
